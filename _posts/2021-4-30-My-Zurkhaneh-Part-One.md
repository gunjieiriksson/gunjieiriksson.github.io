title: My Zurkhaneh Part One

## A brief introduction into zurkhaneh rituals
The zurkhaneh is a domed gymnasium with a center pit in which athletes perform a number of exercises that are very unique to the modern world and are very intriguing. Although, I would say modern gyms are only common within the past 50 years. Quite a few training practices include elements of those seen inside a zurkhaneh, but it stands out by having a more defined method.
While the implements used inside a zurkhaneh aren't commonly seen today, the style of training fits rather nicely with recent trends of functional strength training, yoga, and aerobics. 
I'm no expert on this subject, but I'm certainly giving it a go, and I have had lots of fun doing so. The order of the exercises seems to be how it's done, but don't take my word for it. Either way, I'm going to do it my way and share with you what I've found.
A brief note: there is a strong moral and religious aspect of training in a zurkhaneh, and while I wish I got to exercise in church instead of sitting for hours, I'm only going to say, just be nice.

## Sang
The training inside a zurkhaneh is supposed to prepare you for war (in ancient times), and so each tool is made  to resemble or strengthen your use in a certain aspect of battle. First up on our list is the shield. In the zurkhaneh, athletes lift huge wooden shields in each hand with holes cut out of the middle and handles placed inside while lying on their backs. It looks like quite the chest workout. I must say I'm jealous to not have access to these shields. But, weights are abundant for purchase, and chances are, you've got a couple lying about your garage with rusty handles. So, I'm going to try my hand at making a fun workout with typical weights. 

## Dumbbell or Kettlebell
When I was talking about the rusting weights in your garage, I was thinking of these. Even I have a couple lying around. If you ask me, this is probably the closest you'll get to a sang without going through much hassle. The weight is distributed parallel to the handle much like a giant slab of wood, except, in the case of a dumbbell, only in two directions. But it's good enough for me. You also can't rotate the shields in your hand to rest them on your forearm in the top neutral position, so it isn't as hard on your grip. Without that aspect, it is very similar to a dumbbell chest press if you're like me and do them on the floor. 
If you have two kettlebells of the same weight, you can do the same thing. Only this time, your keeping the weight as it would be on the top of the press. I'd have to say I prefer the kettlebell as it pulls out on your chest and challenges your grip a little more. 
Now here's the twist, it's not just about pressing. Let's take a look at five different kettlebell or dumbbell presses (or both)you can do in the style of pressing sang.

### 1. Rotating Chest Press
This press isn't far off from your typical dumbbell chest press. The difference here is that you start at the top of the press in a neutral grip, and as you go down, you pronate your wrists and end in the standard fashion. When you press back up, just reverse the motion. Make sure and keep your forearms perpendicular to the floor.
### 2. Dumbbell Fly
Well, it's close enough. This press is very similar to the first press, except you do not rotate your wrists, so you end at the bottom of the press in a neutral  grip as well. It isn't quite a dumbbell fly because you still must keep your forearms perpendicular to the floor throughout.
### 3. Supinated Chest Press
Still starting in the neutral grip, lower your arms down toward your waste while keeping your forearms perpendicular to the floor. As you lower the weights, supinate your wrists so that the bottom position looks as if you were halfway through a dumbbell curl. Then press back up to the neutral position.
### 4. Single Press
The single press is a one armed version of the rotating chest press. Although, you'll still be holding the other weight high up. As you lower the weight, rotate your upper body towards the pressing arm, lifting your shoulder blade off the ground and keeping the raised weight in a neutral grip. You'll end up resting on your pressing arm while your other arm is in line with your torso. Lower your shoulder blade keeping the raised dumbbell in the neutral position and press back up with the other arm. Now, do the other side.
### 5. Single Rolling Press
In this press, the pressing motion is the same as the single press. However, your lower body is going to get some action in this one. Start with your thighs curled up and your shins parallel to the floor. As you lower one arm, rotate your lower body towards the pressing side, and extend your legs as you reach the bottom. Curl them back in and rotate back to the starting position as you press the dumbbell, and then switch sides. 

Here is a video demonstration:

I find the supinated chest press is the most taxing of these exercises, but the single rolling press still has me confused every now and then. 

In this particular workout, the dumbbells should never touch the ground or each other while pressing, so you wont set them down between exercises. If you wanted just a solid chest workout, I would do about 6 repetitions of each exercise in a row as a set, and then do five sets (you can put them down between sets). If you want to do the whole training session, come back for the rest of this series.
